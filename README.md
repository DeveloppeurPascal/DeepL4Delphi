# Delphi library for using the translation API DeepL

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) is an online text and document translation tool, also available as software and APIs.

This project is a client library in Pascal for Delphi to use the main translation API. Examples of use are also proposed.

To use [the API of DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) you must have a free or paid account.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Languages supported by the Translation API

Check [this page](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/translating-text/) from the translate API documentation to see the list of supported languages.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DeepL4Delphi).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DeepL4Delphi/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
