# DeepL API client library for Delphi

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) is an online text and document translation tool, also available as software and APIs.

This project is a client library in Pascal for Delphi to use the main translation API. Examples of use are also proposed.

To use [the API of DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) you must have a free or paid account.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DeepL4Delphi).

The project's technical documentation, generated with [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/), is available in the ./docs folder and on [GitHub Pages](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/DeepL4Delphi). Further information and related links are available on [the project website](https://deepl4delphi.developpeur-pascal.fr).

If you need explanations or help in using this project in your own, please [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php). I can either direct you to an online resource, or offer you assistance on a fee-for-service basis. You can also contact me at a conference or an online presentation.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DeepL4Delphi/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
